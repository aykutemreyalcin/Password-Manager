# Password Manager in Python

## Overview
This Python script implements a **simple password manager** that allows users to:
- Generate secure passwords
- Store passwords for different services
- Retrieve saved passwords

## How It Works
1. **Generate Password**: Creates a strong, random password of specified length.
2. **Save Password**: Stores passwords in a JSON file with the associated service and username.
3. **Retrieve Password**: Fetches the stored password for a given service.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement **encryption** for password storage
- Add **GUI** for better user experience
- Allow **cloud backup** for passwords
